
JSON VS BSON
JSON :Java Script Object Notation
JSON supports 6 data types:
1.String 2.Number 3.Boolean 4.Array 5.Object 6.Null

BSON:Binary JSON
Apart from json format BSON also supports data types like:
1.Double 2.32-bit integer 3.64-bit integer 4.Regular expression 5.Timestamp 6.Date 7.ObjectId
MongoDB stores documents in BSON format. It is due to the reason that it supports multiple data types.
